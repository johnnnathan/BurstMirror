    <div id="solution-container">Load up ghidra and open the binary.

Inside the main function there is a call to "check_pass()". Follow the call and you will see two interesting things. The password is 
passed to the program through arguments, and the length of the password needs to be a multiple of three, while also being a 
prime number. Looking up a list of 3 digit prime numbers and passing a few of them as input to the program will grant us a flag.

Have a great day :)
