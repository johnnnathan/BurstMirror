    <h2>📝 Solution</h2>

    <div id="solution-container">The program asks us to provide a password consisting of 16 capital alphabetic and numeric characters. A function then calculates the checksum of the first 15 characters using "checksum = ((checksum + character ) >> 1) % 0xf00 + 0xa". If the final character of the string is equal to the checksum value that was computed the success message is shown.

Have a great day :)
