    <h1>Plain Sight by l3a4dam</h1>
    <h2>📝 Solution</h2>

    <div id="solution-container">For this challenge we do not even need to open a disassembler. You can use the strings command using the executable as an argument and at the point where the "Enter the password: " message can be found, the password can too. 

Pass "do_not_hardcode" as the password to the program and you will get a "Welcome!" message.


Have a great day :)
