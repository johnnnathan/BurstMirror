    <h1>Crackme Speedrun by piggy63</h1>
    <h2>📝 Solution</h2>

    <div id="solution-container">Open the executable using x32dbg, search for strings and find the "Password:" string. Near it you can find "qwerty" saved as a string. Before the strcmp call there is another function call that performs anti-debugging, turn that into nop and step through the execution, you will be able to see a "Correct" message before the window shuts down.


Have a great day :)
