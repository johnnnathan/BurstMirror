    <h1>Baby Keygen 4 by 2ourc3</h1>
    <h2>📝 Solution</h2>

    <div id="solution-container">This challenge follows the same format at the previous one but this time the passowrd needs to have a length of 11, "A" as the first character and "X" as the fourth and eight character. Giving "AXXXXXXXXXX" three times gives the flag but the keygen can also be used.

Have a great day :)
