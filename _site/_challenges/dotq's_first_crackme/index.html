<p>Solution to “dotqw’s first c(rack me)” by 0ya3um1</p>

<p>This is the first .NET application that I have cracked, so I needed some new tools to crack this program.
I did attempt to use ghidra to decompile, and x64dbg to debug but neither of them were helpful. JetBrains’ “dotPeek” application
is a wonderful tool that I’ll use instead.</p>

<p>The program just asks for a password, which probably means there won’t be any moving part in the back-end. I looked at the Form object, 
which probably is what we see when we run the app, and under it there are a few more components. The checkButton component immediately 
caught my attention, since there will probably be a password check close to its declaration in the code. The first line shows</p>

<p>“if (this.keyfield.Text == “XOQIBwcLudyp6NG”)”</p>

<p>which when tried results in a success screen.</p>

<p>Have a great day :)</p>
