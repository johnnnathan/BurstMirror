<p>This challenge can be solved through static analysis, but I found the decompilation to be a bit annoying to read, so I used a 
debugger instead.</p>

<p>Load up the executable into x64dbg and search for strings. Follow the “enter license key:” string to find the main method. 
At one point in the function there are three comparisons, alongside their corresponding jumps, in quick succession. 
The innermost jump breaks out of the loop that keeps asking for input when it’s wrong. The first condition checks if 
the length of the input is equal to 5, the second checks if the first four characters are equal to 0x30343132, and 
the third one if the final character is equal to ‘1’. Giving “04121” as the input to the program won’t work because 
the data has been formatted in Little Endian, this means that we have to reverse the first part of the input. 
If we pass “21401”  as input to the program we will get a “Correct Key” message.</p>

<p>Have a great day :)
