<p>Solution to ‚Äúmy first crackme‚Äù by kvfs</p>

<p>When starting this application we are only asked for a password. Since there is no username requirement I immediately knew that this 
would use either a static password or a math heavy generation algorithm. I loaded it up in ghidra and found the 
main method to be quite simple. C/C++ applications usually have an easy to find entry point.</p>

<p>An output and input call are immediately used to print the message to the terminal and receive the user‚Äôs password. Then a few variable 
assignments and conditionals can be found that compare a lot of values to 15, and then one final if statement can be found that breaks 
out of the infinite input loop, if all the conditions are met. Skipping the accompanying jumps in the debugger informs us that the 
password is correct. Since we know that we need to fullfil the conditions inside that final if statement we should analyze them more.</p>

<p>The output of the memcmp call before it needs to be equal to 0, two variables need to be equal to each other and another variable 
needs to be greater than 3.</p>

<p>if (memcmpResult == 0 &amp;&amp; var2 &lt;= var3 &amp;&amp; var3 &lt;= var2 &amp;&amp; var4 &gt; 3) can be simplified to if(memcmpResult == 0 &amp;&amp; var2 == var3 &amp;&amp; var4 &gt; 3)</p>

<p>The creator of the crackme added in the description that said that the password needs to be at least 3 characters long so we know that 
that is embodied in the final condition, meaning that we won‚Äôt have to spend any time on it.</p>

<p>Following the execution of the program inside the debugger we can see that after a custom function call the reversed given password can 
be seen inside the cpu registers. The length of the password can also be found inside them, assisting me in the decompilation process.
Another string can also be found inside the stack, it is longer than the given password and contains what seem to be random values if 
the password given consists of only numbers. In reality it is the inverted password but instead of using the decimal notation 
ASCII notation is used.</p>

<p>The value of the inverted string is stored inside a buffer object in ghidra. Looking at the decompiled version of the code we see that 
the same object is used in the memcmp call alongside the original password. We can realize then that the original and inverted password 
then need to share some property that allows them to be evaluated as the same. Anybody with some coding experience will to the 
concept of palindromes. Palindromes in short are words or strings that are read the same way front to back as they are back to front.</p>

<p>Ex.
12321
ABBA
EeveE</p>

<p>Inputting 11111, or any other palindrome, as the password gives us a ‚ÄúPassword Accepted‚Äù message.</p>
