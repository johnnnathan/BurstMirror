<p>Open the exeucutable in your disassembler of choice. We can see a printf call asking the user for the password and a scanf after. The given password is compared against the value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1234</code>. Giving <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1234</code> as input to the program will result in 5 “You cracked it!” messages being printed in the terminal.</p>

<p>Have a great day :)
