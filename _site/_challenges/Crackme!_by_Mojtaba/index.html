<p>This is a Visual Basic program so that means that we can use VBReFormer to get a better disassembly than what we would get using ghidra or Binary Ninja. Inside the “Module1” object we can find var_7 being initialized with the value of the password. Giving “8YL4-H4LL-HLAH-WH6R-1K6C” as the input will turn the form object green and open “Form2”.</p>

<p>Have a great day :)
