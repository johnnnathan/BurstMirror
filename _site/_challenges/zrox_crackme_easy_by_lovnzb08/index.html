<p>Open dotPeek and import the executable. Look into the “olartik” component and then into the “Form1” component. There are a few pages 
with code but the one we want to examine is the “txtKey” file. In the “btnLogin_Click” function, which executes whenever the “Giris” 
button is pressed, we can find a line comparing the input we gave the program to the “sifreyok” string.  Giving that as input will 
show us a “Success” message written in Turkish.</p>

<p>Have a great day :)
