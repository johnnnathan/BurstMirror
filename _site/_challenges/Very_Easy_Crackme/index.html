<p>Solution to “Very Easy Crackme” by vasa</p>

<p>This is not an orthodox keygen, instead of creating the Password dynamically the password is always the product of a simple rule
Vasa uses puts(), scanf, and most importantly strcat. This concatenates one string with another.
strcat uses the local_78 and local_10 variables. local_78 in this case, for me, is the username and local_10 a value that 
is stored in hex. If we turn the hex into a string we will get the value of “0xjfkD2”. This means that each password will be just 
the string with that value added to it at the end. Quite simple.</p>

<p>Have a great day :)</p>
