<p>Solution to “StillAching’s CrackMe” by StillAching</p>

<p>This is a relatively easy CrackMe despite having a 6.0 difficulty rating at this moment.</p>

<p>Although this application can be statically analyzed, it utilizes a lot of functions that make it difficult to understand the execution 
process. Running it in a debugger still suffers from that fact, but the impact is much lesser.</p>

<p>The input is given by the user and then many jumps and method calls occur. At a certain point a jump happens and the failure message is 
shown. We can follow the execution in reverse and by finding the references to the destination of the jump and we come across the code 
snippet where the comparison between the given and the stored password takes place.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mov rcx, rbx
call function 
test eax,eax 
jump
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The rbx register holds a location inside the dump. Looking inside we see a big block of data that is neatly organized. One interesting 
value is “StillAching@CrackMes.one” which when given as the password results in a Password Accepted message</p>

<p>Have a great day :)
