<p>Solution to “Interesting Crackme” by BananaGrease</p>

<p>Very simple challenge, to get back into groove. I completed this challenge through just the debugger.</p>

<p>Load up the executable into your debugger and search for strings. There is a string for the failure scenario
and one for the success scenario. My debugger did not stop at them so I spread out breaks at many points in the function.</p>

<p>I gave as username the string “abcdefgh” and as password the string “1231231231231231” (I explain this later). On the stack
there is a string with the value of “acegikmo()*+,-./”. With some pattern recognition you can tell that the characters of the 
username are incremented by a certain value and the remaining characters filled up with a set pattern (This can be seen 
through using different combinations).</p>

<p>The amount they get incremented by is their position inside the string. So the first element gets incremented by 0, the second 
by 1, the third by 2 etc. since we use 0-indexing.</p>

<p>By setting the username to 0 we can find that the pattern is “X!"#$%&amp;’()*+,-./”(More on this under the end note).</p>

<p>What remains is putting all the information together and writing a keygen.</p>

<p>!Note on the set pattern:
The set pattern is not actually set, it is a by-product of the way the application is programmed, as can be seen through the 
code posted by the creator of the challenge. The password string is initialized with spaces which means that incrementing the 
value with the position index will result in the symbol pattern found.</p>
