<p>Load up the executable in your favourite disassembler and locate the main method. There is a printf call , then a scanf function 
handling our input and a call to _generate_password. Inside the function the ID of the current process is fetched and added to 
the end of “EndIsNear-“. The result is then compared against our input, and a message is shown depending on the result of the condition.</p>

<p>The easiest way to find the PID of the program is to open up Task Manager and enable the PID option by right clicking on the name header.</p>

<p>Have a great day :)
