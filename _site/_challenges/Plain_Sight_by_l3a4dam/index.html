<p>For this challenge we do not even need to open a disassembler. You can use the strings command using the executable as an argument and at the point where the “Enter the password: “ message can be found, the password can too.</p>

<p>Pass “do_not_hardcode” as the password to the program and you will get a “Welcome!” message.</p>

<p>Have a great day :)
