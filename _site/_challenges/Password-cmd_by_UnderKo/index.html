<p>The evaluation function for the given password is quite simple. The given input is passed through the sscanf() function with the %d 
type parameter, this means that the programs tries to extract an integer from the input and store the output to another variable. 
The output is then compared against the value 10 and if they are equal the success message is shown. This means that we just need 
to pass ‘10’ as input without any other characters before it, characters that come after it will be disregarded as long as they 
are not numbers, since that will change the result of the sscanf function call.</p>

<p>Weirdly enough, the output of the sscanf function is stored in an array, and the first element is tested in the condition, 
so giving invalid input after a successful  attempt will still show the success message.</p>

<p>Have a great day :)
