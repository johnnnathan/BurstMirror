<h1>Easy To Crack By Whiter0Se</h1>

<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>In the description of the challenge the creator tells us that the password is stored as an integer inside the application. This means that searching for strings won&#x27;t give us anything of importance. Inside the main function a &quot;puts&quot; call is made and after it a call to a custom function. Inside it a &quot;scanf&quot; call is made with the value being stored in the third argument. The third argument is then compared against the value &quot;502590&quot; and if the given password is equal to it a success message is shown. 

Have a great day :)
