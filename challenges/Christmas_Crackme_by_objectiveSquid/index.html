<h1>Christmas Crackme By Objectivesquid</h1>

<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>Inside the main function a memcmp call is made with the given password and the stored password. Set a breakpoint at the memcmp call and inside the EAX register you will be able to find the password. Giving &quot;Santa123&quot; as the password will show us a success message. The application is 32 bit so you will have to use a debugger that is able to handle it, Binary Ninja cannot but x32dbg can.

Have a great day :)
