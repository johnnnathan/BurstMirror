<h1>Super Easy By Eventhorizon02</h1>

<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>Load up ghidra and open the binary.

Inside the main function there is a call to &quot;check_pass()&quot;. Follow the call and you will see two interesting things. The password is 
passed to the program through arguments, and the length of the password needs to be a multiple of three, while also being a 
prime number. Looking up a list of 3 digit prime numbers and passing a few of them as input to the program will grant us a flag.

Have a great day :)
