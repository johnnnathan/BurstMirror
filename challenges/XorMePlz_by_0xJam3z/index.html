<h1>Xormeplz By 0Xjam3Z</h1>

<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>The program has the string &quot;0xJam3z&quot; stored in plaintext, and then performs a character-wise xor operation on it with the key 0x6d. The given password is then put through the same operation, and the outputs are compared. This means that we can give &quot;0xJam3z&quot; to get the success message, which was probably a design flaw that was overlooked by the developer.

  

Have a great day :)
