<h1>Password And Username Guess By Breadleaf</h1>

<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>When we run the program it asks us to provide two strings that are separated by a space. We can consider the first string 
to be the username and the second one the password.

Inside the main function there is a call to an operator named &quot;main::$_0::operator(param1, param2)&quot;. It&#x27;s name doesn&#x27;t tell us much 
about its functionality but we are quickly able to tell what it is doing by looking at the code. There is a loop that iterates over 
all of the characters of the username and stores their sum in a separate variable. At the end of the loop the sum is returned to 
the main function and the result used in a comparison against the length of the password. If the sum of the characters is equal 
to the length of the password then we get a simple &quot;y&quot; to signify that the combination was accepted.

Have a great day :)
