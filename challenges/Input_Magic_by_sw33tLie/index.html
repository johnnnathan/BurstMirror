<h1>Input Magic By Sw33Tlie</h1>

<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>Some setup is done at the top of the main function and then the program asks for a license. The input that is given is then processed further by storing only the first character of the string in a separate variable. The first character is then used in the following conditional statements:

char % 60 == 3
char &gt; 42
char &lt; 72

The only decimal value that is accepted by all of these conditions is 63 which translates to &quot;?&quot;. Giving any string that starts with a question mark will result in the success message being shown.

Have a great day :)
