    <h1>Input Magic by sw33tLie</h1>
    <h2>📝 Solution</h2>

    <div id="solution-container">Some setup is done at the top of the main function and then the program asks for a license. The input that is given is then processed further by storing only the first character of the string in a separate variable. The first character is then used in the following conditional statements:

char % 60 == 3
char > 42
char < 72

The only decimal value that is accepted by all of these conditions is 63 which translates to "?". Giving any string that starts with a question mark will result in the success message being shown.

Have a great day :)
