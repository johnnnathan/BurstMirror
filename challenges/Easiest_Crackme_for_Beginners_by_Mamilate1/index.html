<h1>Easiest Crackme For Beginners By Mamilate1</h1>

<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>Disassemble the program and find the main function, there is only one variable that is initialized. The value of the variable 
is 0x4d2 or&quot;1234&quot; in ASCII. Pass &quot;1234&quot; as the input to the program and the window will shut down. To see the output of the program, 
load the executable into a debugger and find the same location you were at by running the program until it stops. Put a couple 
breakpoints on following instructions and the program should output &quot;You cracked it!&quot; a handful of times.

Have a great day :)
