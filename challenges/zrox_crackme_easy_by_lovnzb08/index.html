<h1>Zrox Crackme Easy By Lovnzb08</h1>

<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>Open dotPeek and import the executable. Look into the &quot;olartik&quot; component and then into the &quot;Form1&quot; component. There are a few pages 
with code but the one we want to examine is the &quot;txtKey&quot; file. In the &quot;btnLogin_Click&quot; function, which executes whenever the &quot;Giris&quot; 
button is pressed, we can find a line comparing the input we gave the program to the &quot;sifreyok&quot; string.  Giving that as input will 
show us a &quot;Success&quot; message written in Turkish.

Have a great day :)
