For this challenge we are only expected to patch the function to always accept a password. I encountered some issues with this 
program and I was not able to execute it, my solution should be correct but may require some minor tweaks.

Open ghidra and load up the executable. Search for strings and find the &quot;Please enter the password:&quot; entry. Find the function in which 
the string gets used and we can start patching. A few lines after the message gets used we can find a comparison and a jump.

`
MOVZX EAL, AL
TEST EAX, EAX
JZ LAB...
`

If the value in EAX is \0, the JZ (jump if zero) instruction executes, leading to the &quot;Access Denied&quot; message. We don‚Äôt want that 
to happen, so we‚Äôll modify this jump. To always reach the &quot;Access Granted&quot; message we can change the &quot;JZ LAB&quot; instruction into a 
&quot;NOP&quot; instruction, this means that NO Operation will be performed and thus the program will step into the conditional block that 
we want it to. At the end of the code block the code will jump into the cleanup area of the code, so we don&#x27;t have to worry about
any other operations reverting our progress.

Have a great day :)
