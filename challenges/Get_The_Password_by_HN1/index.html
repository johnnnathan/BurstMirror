<h1>Get The Password By Hn1</h1>

<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>In this challenge we give a key to the program, the characters of which are then evaluated in custom if statements, depending on their index. Our goal is to get a final score of 10 correct characters, which means that we have to carefully craft a string. Covering each if statement individually would take too long so it&#x27;s easier to lay out the general pattern of each if statement.

Depending on the index of the character a different number is used as a limit, the character at the position is then compared against it using a unique jump statement. Some blocks use &#x27;je&#x27; others &#x27;jge&#x27; or &#x27;ja&#x27;. If the conditions are not tripped the score of the correct characters is decremented, which complicates the formation of the string. The easiest way to get a correct string is to manually pick the next highest or the next lowest value depending on the requirements of the block and then adding a padding character to the end. I was able to get &quot;HlVf2z8L22&quot;, which results in &quot;Password is correct! ;)&quot; being printed to the terminal.

Have a great day :)
