<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>Using &quot;strings&quot; on the executable returns a fake flag and the messages that we will see when executing the program. The program first asks for a password. Using &quot;Sup3rS3cr3tP455W0rd&quot; as found through &quot;strings&quot;, grants us access to the next stage, where we are asked to provide a code. This stage can not be completed through the previously mentioned method and so we need to open the program in a disassembler. The code is minimally obfuscated and we can see that the variable that was initialized with the scanf call is compared against &quot;0x539&quot; or &quot;1337&quot; in decimal. Passing &quot;1337&quot; to the program as the secret code gives us the flag.

  

Have a great day :)
