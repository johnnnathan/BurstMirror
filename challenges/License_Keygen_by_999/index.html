<h2>üîë Keygen</h2>
<pre># Keygen for &quot;Licence Keygen&quot; By 999
# 
# Another .NET program. We will use dotPeek just as we did for &quot;dotqw&#x27;s first crackme&quot;. 
# I put the application in the program and started searching for objects that I could use to find the password.
# This crackme uses a gui which makes it easier to detect value handling. I found a method by the name of &quot;GenerateSerialKey&quot; and knew
# I was close. I looked at the contents of the method and it divided the key into three segments. The first segment 
# was the basic username, the second the username with &quot;salt1&quot; appended to it and the third one the username with &quot;salt2&quot; appended to it.
# GenerateSegment was the function that handled all the logic behind the key generation. Since we do not have to deal with assembly, or 
# pseudocode we can easily transform the .NET code into usable python code.
#
# It computes the sha256 hash of the individual segment and then iterates over the first two indexes of the hash while doing some 
# calculations. It mods the value of the character on the current intex and the one at an offset of 2, using the value 36.
# Then it takes the ASCII code and through a simple if statement, calculates the values that the segment&#x27;s key should consist of.
# 
# Example:
#   Username: abcd
#   Key     : S2W3-I0WI-D9LM
# 
#
# Have a great day :)
