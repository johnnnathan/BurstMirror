    <h1>Find password by TheReverser</h1>
    <h2>📝 Solution</h2>

    <div id="solution-container">Inside the main function the program asks the user to give their password in Italian. After function call where the input is handled the program performs a memcmp operation using our given password and the stored password. The stored password is equal to "djejie" and if we pass that as input we will get a "benvenuto" message.

Have a great day :)
