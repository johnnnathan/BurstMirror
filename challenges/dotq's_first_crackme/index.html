<h1>Dotq'S First Crackme</h1>

<h2>üìù Solution</h2>
<pre>Solution to &quot;dotqw&#x27;s first c(rack me)&quot; by 0ya3um1

This is the first .NET application that I have cracked, so I needed some new tools to crack this program.
I did attempt to use ghidra to decompile, and x64dbg to debug but neither of them were helpful. JetBrains&#x27; &quot;dotPeek&quot; application
is a wonderful tool that I&#x27;ll use instead. 

The program just asks for a password, which probably means there won&#x27;t be any moving part in the back-end. I looked at the Form object, 
which probably is what we see when we run the app, and under it there are a few more components. The checkButton component immediately 
caught my attention, since there will probably be a password check close to its declaration in the code. The first line shows 

&quot;if (this.keyfield.Text == &quot;XOQIBwcLudyp6NG&quot;)&quot;

which when tried results in a success screen.



Have a great day :)
