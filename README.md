# Crackme Solutions Viewer

This project is a mirror of my ["Crack"](https://github.com/johnnnathan/Crack) repository, created for easier visualization of the challenges and their solutions. It provides a user-friendly interface that displays various crackme challenges, making it simpler to browse through the solutions and keygen files.

Please note that this mirror is not constantly updated. It reflects a snapshot of the Crack repository at a particular point in time.

This collection is the biggest Crackme solution database on the internet, making it an invaluable resource for reverse engineering enthusiasts.
